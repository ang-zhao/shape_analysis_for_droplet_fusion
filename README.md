# shape_analysis_for_droplet_fusion
This repository contains the code and report from my undergraduate honors project, "Quantitative shape analysis of in vivo Kar9: droplet-like behaviour during fusion" -- completed in August 2022 as part of the degree requirements for McGill University School of Computer Science.

This work contributed to the publication [A fluid droplet harvests the force generated by shrinking microtubules in living cells by Morelli et al. 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.09.612121v1).
